  <div class="banner-hanging-number"><p class="summery-title">Summary:</p><p>Kupu Rangi is an interactive visual language app that invites users to grow their universe and Te Reo Māori knowledge one word at a time. Stars on the moon represent words, and kāhui whetū form as users collect and learn vocabulary.
</p> 
  </div>
  <p class="project-date-top">The AI companion Nui, inspired by Ranginui, is a supportive, father-like guide who uses ako principles to shape a personalised learning journey. By asking about the user’s dialect and preferences, he adapts the colour of their moon, the encouragement he gives, and the resources he shares. This connection between user and AI reflects whakawhanaungatanga, building relationships through shared understanding. Nui’s presence across every screen makes the app feel alive, offering regular prompts to boost motivation.</p>

    <h2>Campaign Centre</h2>
    <p>
This project was centred around a promtional video and campaign. This created the inital interest for the app as well as acted as the backbone for the genreal user story to be based. 

<br><br>

From the video you can begin to understand how Kupu-Rangi connects to you and how you can begin your learning experience, enguaging more with Kupu and begin your learning journey.

  <div id="kupu-3" class="project-image"></div>
    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning-2">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
Kupu Rangi was developed in response to Kupu’s declining usage, which stemmed from a lack of immersive and culturally meaningful features. Spark’s Riki Hollings shared their vision for Kupu 3.0, challenging us to reimagine its future to reignite interest and attract new users while remaining true to its Māori values and origins.
</p>
</div>

<div class="stage-divider">
  <div id="kupu-4" class="project-image"></div>
    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <p>
The process was guided by Tikanga Māori, embedding whakapapa, kaitiakitanga, manaakitanga, oranga, and kotahitanga across both design and collaboration. This foundation of values was carried through in practice, with co-learning shaping the outcome, most notably through Spark’s suggestion of Nui taking a more active role with users.

    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
    <p>
Optics focuses on maintaining a simple user flow while offering an expansive range of features. Its unique structure preserves clarity and minimizes overstimulation.

<br><br>

Adding a film is straightforward: tap to add, type the film’s name, and select it. Multiple opinion options, including a quick add feature and the ability to add a film without rating it first, keep the app user-controlled.

<div class="stage-divider">
  <div id="kupu-6" class="project-image"></div>
    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>Groups</h2>
    <p>
Create a group and select a set of films, Optics lets you configure each list exactly how you want. You can create multiple groups, ensuring as much personalization of each group’s film list as you prefer.

<br><br> 


These small groups foster a close-knit sense of community around your opinions, while also offering inclusion and personalisation in your lists.

    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>Profile Customisation</h2>
    <p>
By accessing your profile, you can track your personal film stats, favorite films, and manage your groups. It also provides friends with a general overview of your taste and activity.

<div class="stage-divider">
  <div id="kupu-8" class="project-image"></div>
    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>Expanded Feature Pages</h2>
    <p>
Separate from the app’s core functions, you can also filter your list by specific genres or let Optics randomly select a film based on custom filters. While optional, these features add a layer of fun and use your personal inputs to create a tailored experience for each user.

  <div id="kupu-9" class="project-image"></div>
    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>
Four rounds of defining user testing, each involving five participants, had a significant impact on the app’s layout and user flow. These tests helped shape a final product that is both intuitive to use and rich in supporting features.
