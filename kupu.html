In a live brief in collaboration with Spark, we transformed the apps visual identity and features.

  <p class="project-date-top"> Incorporating heavier use of AI, with a dedicated AI companion and focus around gamifaction, that incorporated cultural concepts to better immerse the users in a meaningful learning journey.

To further expand on the band’s unique identity, a great deal of care was taken in the site’s design — combining rough, static elements with a more modern flair.

    <h2>Learning Process & Gallery Feature</h2>
    <p>
The learning process was kept simple, structuring the idea around of collecting star words that appear on your 3D interactive moon. Tapping on these star words would allow you to begin learning a word.
<br><br>
Breaking the word down to its core meaning, and use in a sentence, you can then use your phones microphone to complete the process of learning the word. Finally swiping the learnt star word up and sending it off to form your kahui whetu (constellations) screen.
<br><br>
You are also able to gain bonus words each day by using the camera feature. These will then be stored in your gallery, where you can reflect on your learning journey through you photographs. Helping with greater memory retention and adding another element to the learning experience.

    <h2>Kahui Whetu</h2>
<p>
Once you’ve learnt a word you can swipe up on your home screen to see your Kahui Whetu (constellations), this is how you track your progression in the app. Each star word you learn, brightens a constellation and in turn grows your universe. In you’re Kahui Whetu screen you are able to see the words you’ve learnt, how many you have yet to learn, and revisit the meanings of words you may have forgotten.
<br><br>
Each star word, will appear in a constellation grouped with similar words to it. This makes filling up your universe less linear and more explorative. Allowing you to become more immersed in the language by surrounding yourself in the language.

    <h2>AI Companion, Nui</h2>
    <p>
While using the app at anytime you can speak to Nui, the AI companion. This allows you to talk through and get a better understanding on how to use the words your learning. 
<br><br>
You can choose to message Nui using the messaging screen, or speak with him verbally using the call function. This is especially helpful for more complex breakdowns, pronunciations, helpful resources and conversational practice using your newly learnt words. While calling Nui you also able to get real-time, live word translations using the camera and video feature.

    <h2>Polaroid Campaign</h2>
    <p>
Optics focuses on maintaining a simple user flow while offering an expansive range of features. Its unique structure preserves clarity and minimizes overstimulation.

<br><br>

Adding a film is straightforward: tap to add, type the film’s name, and select it. Multiple opinion options, including a quick add feature and the ability to add a film without rating it first, keep the app user-controlled.

    <h2>User Testing and Feedback</h2>
    <p>
During the creation of the app, Kupu Rangi went through several stages of user testing. These tests helped determine the best user flow and key features the app needed. As the app revolved around simple swipe gestures to access each screen, an easy structure and simple user flow, these tests was extremely important apps development to resonate with the target audience. 
<br><br>
Core concepts, especially those tied to culturally sensitive ideas, were crucial to approach with meaningful care. During this project, 4 user tests were conducted and extensive feedback was given in these tests and separately by the Spark team.

<br><br> 


These small groups foster a close-knit sense of community around your opinions, while also offering inclusion and personalisation in your lists.

    <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
    <p>
The final outcome is a detailed and culturally centred approach to the learning of Te Reo Maori, that highlights the importance of the language in our culture through an explainer video, promotional video, Polaroid campaign and language learning app.
<br><br>
It shows the effect that AI can have in human-centred design, and how when implemented well can help create a real impact in important everyday spaces. This project succeeded in bringing individuals closer to native language of New Zealand, and connecting individuals to a rich culture.
