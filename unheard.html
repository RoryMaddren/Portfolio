            <h4 class="overview-title">Overview</h4>
            <p class="overview-blurb">Unheard is a project based around the misdiagnosis of endometriosis, a serious health condition that effects 10% of people in their reproductive years, and often has a diagnostic delay of 9  years. This can often lead to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. This project attempts to raise greater awareness for endometriosis and create better discussion around the seriousness of this problem through a abstract model photography, and bold typography in an informative, storytelling book and scrollytelling site.</p>

            <div class="paragraph-text-project">
                <p>For the emotional centre of this project to hit hard we created a video that would document the user journey of this project. This video followed one of the stories documented in the book, outlining the emotional strength of each of the passages using a voice over combined with a mix of 3D and 2D animated elements.</p>

            <h4 class="title-explainer">Research and Focus</h4>
            <div class="paragraph-text-project">
                <p>The beginning of this project came about after the shared shock from each team member as we began to research women's health and found the dramatic misunderstandings and underfunding that surrounded the topic.</p>

                <p>However, nothing was more surprising than the information we found around endometriosis. Stunned by the emotional stories of those that had suffered with a disease and most importantly the misdiagnosis of the disease, despite being so wide spread, we were transfixed by the descriptions of pain and misunderstanding in these stories. We knew that this had to be the soul of this project. Focusing all of the information around five core stories that would be showcased through bold typography, and emotional model photography. The aim was for this abstract approach was to break through and stand apart against other reading material and act more emotional, and visually interesting, yet fact-based.</p>
            </div>

            <h4 class="title-explainer">Branding & Core Ideas</h4>
            <div class="paragraph-text-project">
                <p>The core backbone of this project was build around a strong contrasting monochromatic look. Using bold typography, emotive photography and blending these core ideas together with conceal and reveal design.</p>

                <p>Showcasing the core stories through literal and abstract visuals that would bring about and visually gripping result that would stand apart from its less design focused contemporaries.</p>
            </div>
          </article>


            <article class="project-image-expaliner">

            <h4 class="title-explainer">Through-line</h4>
            <div class="paragraph-text-project">
            <p>Throughout this project, we found that the emotional stories demonstrated exactly the tone we thought they would, and delivered a better understanding around this issue, however left a sense of hopelessness in our audience. From this we decided we could push the idea further and sought to allow those who read the stories a place connect with similar stories as well as find further resources and information if you think you may have endometriosis. </p>

            <p>This created an ever-growing and interactive aspect to the book. Creating the simple user journey of, understanding the issue you might have, discovering the book, exploring more stories and resources, and then finally allowing you a space to share your own personal experience.</p>

            <h4 class="title-explainer">Modelling Process</h4>
            <div class="paragraph-text-project">
            <p>My main task as sole photographer in this project was to organise and shoot several photography sessions. The photo style needed to adapt overtime to push demonstrate the key concept in the stories in a form that would be both visually compelling and emotionally strong.</p>

            <p>Keeping the photographs monochromatic to depict the serious tone, with red used for particularly emotional passages in each section. We decided to focus on the main ideas of sequential photography, mixed with grain to visually demonstrate the progression of pain in the stories. Then feelings of loss of identity would be reflected in the blur and grain of the photograph, as they become physically more difficult to make out.
            </p>

            <p>This strong visual language allowed the book to stay interesting and the user engaged, when mixed the its complex conceal and reveal design and bold typography throughout the over 100 pages.</p>

            <h4 class="title-explainer">Conceal and Reveal</h4>
            <div class="paragraph-text-project">
            <p>The use of conceal and reveal design was a consistent theme in all of the mediums. In the book, the cutout and flaps added the progression and reading of each section, keeping the feeling intimate and working with in conjunction passages.</p>

            <p>The website used animations to demonstrate the same feeling, utilising scroll triggers, parallax, and blur. Finally the video, finding a mix of both, using sequential photography, similar animated flaps and further animations similar to the website and unique to itself worked to conceal and reveal emotional information in to create an emotional through-line through the project.</p>

            <div class="paragraph-text-project">
            <p>To build off the monochromatic branding, I decided early on to cast a cell texture onto each of the models to both visually break up each photograph as well as a way to physically show an invisible disease.</p>

            <p>This then was built upon in the book, using the cell texture against a wall to define a clear start and end point in the book. Comfortably working into the branding and visually preparing the reading for the experience of reading the book.</p>

            <div class="paragraph-text-project">
            <p>The design of website was another big focus, going through several iterations. Primarily as a resource for further learning, and interactive introduction to the stories of endometriosis, we later decided to showcase this information through data visualisation.</p>

            <p>Creating the core pages, included more simple FAQ and resource pages, we also designed a simple interactive map, that took the entries of the users and showcased them visually showing their stage of endometriosis, years of diagnosis and emotional response to healthcare. Creating a stronger focus on the feelings and human side of all of the users of the site.</p>

            <div class="paragraph-text-project">
            <p>For this project we needed to test all aspect, to ensure the emotional impact was felt how we hoped and the core message was being heard as intended. Several test were conducted on both the book and website throughout.</p>

            <p>For the website especially, core concepts from the book were brought over to the visual style to more closely bring them together. Physical elements, attention to typography and general flow of the scrollytelling pieces were heavily iterated on. This made sure the entire experience, following from the video to the book and then the site were felt consistent.</p>

            <p>The end result of this project is a multi-media project that creates an emotional through-line centred around an emotionally important message and core set of stories. Demonstrating the impact of invisible illness and the misunderstanding of these unheard voices.</p>
            
            <p>Using emotional model photography and bold typography in an impactful book and  scrollytelling website, all brought together with an explainer video. Creating a space for those with this disease to understand, learn, seek further support, and connect with others like them.</p>
