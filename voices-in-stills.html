    <h2>Research and Preparation</h2>
    <p>Inspired by the overlaying technique of Robert Rauschenberg
 and the interactive art of Emmanuel Van der Auwera we were interested in created a multifaceted experience driven design. Utilising sound, photography and motion tracking.
</p>
    <h4>
      Research question: <br> How might we explore the emotinal relationship of old sounding voice recording through, motion tracking and glass work photography.
      </h4>
      <p>
      We began by researching Japanese photographer Ken Kitano and planning the original photography trials for the mock line up.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="stage-divider">
  <div id="img-2-vis" class="project-image"></div>
    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>Photography and Editing</h2>
    <p>The photography shoots were next. We shot 6 separate shoots, varying in style, colour, grain, background, pose and distance of the shot. This was in order to assist in the next stages as much as possible, allowing the strongest shot composition possible.

    </p>
    <p>This was then refined in editing, using a basic multiplier adjustment to each photo to get a basic concept on how each photograph will sit on one another. <br><br>
      
    Through several test we found the eyes of each model became a distraction and gave an uneasy feeling. This was similar to the researched photographers work I found, however, through several experiments I found the elementating this aspect pf the final composition created a stronger and more appealing outcome.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="stage-divider">
  <div id="img-3-vis" class="project-image"></div>
    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>Assembling Frame</h2>
    <p>We then moved into the assembly of the photography piece. By sliding the clear film photographs in between A4 sections of glass, we trialed several arrangements to test the composition of the full piece. Eventually after comparing 20 experimental arrangements we found the most visually captivating. 
      </p>
    <p>We found that overlaying a variety of distances and poses and backgrounds in this specific arrangement was strongest. Also by separating each photo with a piece of glass strengthened it further by creating an unexpected 3 dimensional effect when standing at different angles.
    <br><br>We built upon this by pressing the final to images in the same piece of glass. This added more variety and melded these two photos together more so, keeping it more abstract in the deepest portions of the image</p>
</div>
</div>

  <div id="img-4-vis" class="project-image"></div>
    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>Testing frame and final assembly:</h2>
    <p>

We than constructed a functional 2 sided frame that would hold the glass panels in. This was carefully done, as a deviation from the traditional frame meant the structure was fundamentally weaker especially for the weight of the 4 panels of glass.
<br><br>
A wooden stand was then also assembled and painted to match the frame to create a better focal point and structure for the photography piece. </p>

    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>Sound Design:</h2>
    <p>
Using Logic X Pro, and a scarlet interface we recorded a basic chord progression utilizing techniques of several indie musicians specializing in melancholic styled, soft, acoustic guitar soundscapes. This shaped the experience and added further emotion to the spoken voices part of the audio.
<br><br>
The audio was then mixed and altered to fit the sound of an old media recording. This brought greater immersion and lent further into the feeling of nostalgia and the intrinsic emotions associated with that.
<br><br>
The track was purposefully constructed to be very simple to not be too distracting and also to be easily looped without breaking immersion in the experience.
<br><br>
this was tested heavily to ensure it felt authentic and had the intended effect, which after minor adjustments proved to be successful.</p>

<div class="stage-divider">
  <div id="img-4-vis" class="project-image"></div>
    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>Music and Recordings:</h2>
    <p>
Music and voice recordings - methodology of voices and changes made - what did you end up doing for the subject matter and how did you do this

The voices were a primary aspect of this experience, and therefore needed to carry the intended weight. Special attention was given and numerous attempts were done in order to reach this outcome.

The audio proved most effective when using two participants, recorded using a phone speaker, then altered harshly to mimic the effect of an old phone answering phone. 
This melded in perfectly with the music, and using the strong subject matter of loss and the feelings that came with that experience from both speakers, the final audio was extremely effective in conveying important subject matter, in an emotionally gripping form.

    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>Motion Tracking:</h2>
    <p>The next stage was to piece everything together using motion tracking. This was fully realized by using Touch Designers blob detection to understand where the participant was. Then linking this to the audio, the user could control which voice they heard by moving onto one of the two sides of the glass piece. Giving the illusion of hearing the voices through the prominent portrait the participant was looking towards.

To further bring the immersion to its full potential. The music was panned and played continuously on loop independent of the voice lines.

Extra sound effects were then added to bring further user control and immersive feeling, these included and tape recorder rewinding at the end of a voice line and an answering machine beep to indicate when the user had changed sides.</p>

    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>Assembly:</h2>
    <p>Several small tests after the final assembly was done in the installation space. This helped balance the audio levels for the space. The use of noise canceling headphones needed to be used for this as well. Also the motion tracking and lighting issues that came about were swiftly corrected.
<br><br>
To add final details, a logo was constructed and used the same materials as the glass piece, and kept the same themes. On top of this a simple diagram was also made to show off how to use the installation.</p>

    <h2>Detailing:</h2>
    <p>
The final piece was a successful delve into an emotional experience through two voices tracked the positions of the user.
<br><br>
The strong soundscape created an immersive and emotional backdrop for the user to engage fully with the stories being shared through the audio. This was all brought together by the centre piece of photography placed center of the installation.
