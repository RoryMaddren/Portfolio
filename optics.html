  <h1 class="banner-text">Optics</h1>
  <p class="banner-hanging-number">In today’s landscape, where opinions are often shared publicly and performatively, mainstream platforms function largely as social media. They lack the intimacy and authenticity of conversations shared among real-life friends.</p> 
  
  <p class="project-date-top">Optics seeks to resolve this issue by creating a more intimate space for small groups of friends to rate, compare, and contrast their favorite films with a dedicated collaborative film list. Share thoughts, leave notes, and share your own list  based on your cinematic tastes.</p>

    <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
    <p>
The landscape is dominated primarily by Letterboxd and IMDb. While successful in their concept, these platforms function mainly as social media-inspired public forums and lack the intimacy and genuine conversation.

<br><br>

Through research and three conducted interviews, we concluded that especially with the current move away from social media sites, a large number of individuals are greatly unsatisfied with these existing solutions.

    <h2>Spreadsheet Conversion</h2>
<p>
  The concept of Optics was originally derived from an Excel spreadsheet. While the core idea remained strong, expanding its scope quickly revealed the limitations of the spreadsheet format.

Although conceptually sound, we aimed to evolve the spreadsheet concept visually and incorporate more complex interactions and features.

  <div id="optics-3" class="project-image"></div>
    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>Detailed Design</h2>
    <p>
The use of hierarchy and consistent spacing in 12px increments was important to keep the information clear, manageable, and easy to digest.

<br><br>

Inspired by the flow of the original spreadsheet, we innovated on the grid style and arrangement of its core information. This allowed for an informed, function-focused approach to the app.

    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>Open, Explore, Search, Add</h2>
    <p>
Optics focuses on maintaining a simple user flow while offering an expansive range of features. Its unique structure preserves clarity and minimizes overstimulation.

<br><br>

Adding a film is straightforward: tap to add, type the film’s name, and select it. Multiple opinion options, including a quick add feature and the ability to add a film without rating it first, keep the app user-controlled.

    <h2>Groups</h2>
    <p>
Create a group and select a set of films, Optics lets you configure each list exactly how you want. You can create multiple groups, ensuring as much personalization of each group’s film list as you prefer.

<br><br> 


These small groups foster a close-knit sense of community around your opinions, while also offering inclusion and personalisation in your lists.

    <h2>Profile Customisation</h2>
    <p>
By accessing your profile, you can track your personal film stats, favorite films, and manage your groups. It also provides friends with a general overview of your taste and activity.

    <h2>Expanded Feature Pages</h2>
    <p>
Separate from the app’s core functions, you can also filter your list by specific genres or let Optics randomly select a film based on custom filters. While optional, these features add a layer of fun and use your personal inputs to create a tailored experience for each user.

    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>
Four rounds of defining user testing, each involving five participants, had a significant impact on the app’s layout and user flow. These tests helped shape a final product that is both intuitive to use and rich in supporting features.
