    <h2>Spreadsheet Conversion:

</h2>
    <p>The concept of Optics was originally derived from an Excel Spreadsheet. With the same core focus, we found upon expanding the scope of ideas the limitations of spreadsheet became more glaring.

This solidified the concept of the idea was sound though could be expanded to further incorporate more complex ideas and nicer presentation in the form of an app.

    <h2>Competitor Analysis:</h2>
    <p>The current landscape appeared dominated by Letterboxd, and IMDB. These were successful in what they sought out to create. However, these are public platforms that function primarily as a form of social media, and lack the intimate and more genuine feeling associated with a conversation with real life friends.
<br><br>
Through research and one on one surveys, we concluded that especially with the outlook of social media sites currently this would benefit a large percentage of individuals greatly.

  <div id="optics-3" class="project-image"></div>
    <div class="stage-divider-text-aligning">
    <h2>Detailed Design:</h2>
    <p>
The use of Hierarchy and a consistent spacing with increments of 12px was important to keep the information as easy to digest as possible.
<br><br>
Inspired by flow of the original spreadsheet, we innovated on the grid style feeling and arrangement of the information. This allowed for an informed and function focused approach to the app.</p>

    <h2>Explore * Add * Rate * Compare</h2>
    <p>
Optics focuses on keeping the user flow simple. While having an expansive scope of features, There is no sense of being overwhelmed or confused with it’s unique structure.
<br><br>
Adding a film is as simple as clicking add, typing the name of the film and submitting. The opinion to add without a rating keeps the app as user controlled as possible.</p>

    <h2>Groups:</h2>
    <p>
Starting by creating a group of friends and selecting a set of films, Optics allows you configure the list as you see fit. Expanding on this, create separate groups, and ensure as much personalization of each group’s list as preferred.

These small groups allow for the close feeling of community in your opinions as well as a sense of inclusion and personalization in you lists.</p>

    <p>
Separate from the core functions of the app, Optics allows you to -  Filter your list by even more specific selections, and as well randomly choose a film based on your decided filters. These bring further fun to the rating experience and utilize your personal inputs to create a user specific outcome for each person.
