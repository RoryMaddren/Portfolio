  <div class="banner-hanging-number"><p class="summery-title">Summary:</p><p>
Entering into the pop music space, a newly formed band comprising Drummer/Producer Shelton Woolright and Vocalist/Producer Alex Thompson needed a brand new brand identity and website.</p> 
  </div>
  <p class="project-date-top">Using inspiration from their influences, namely Twenty One Pilots and Blink-182, among others, we created a strong brand identity and website with an extensive built in campaign all focused around static grunge contrasted with modern-influenced ideas.</p>

    <h2>Branding and Focus</h2>
<p>Based on the band’s predetermined aesthetic, we created a focused brand identity that reflected their style. Utilizing a grunge-meets-modern approach, we crafted a patchwork-inspired, rugged look that would later be expanded across the campaign’s collateral.
<br><br>

We delved deep into the style of Twenty One Pilots, along with other grunge-inspired musician websites — drawing heavy influence from their branding and the unique focus of their web experiences.</p>

    <h2>Research:</h2>
<p>
Of the dozens of researched sites, only a few stood out by giving users a reason to engage beyond general ticket sales.
<br><br>
We found that some, such as Post Malone’s and Bring Me The Horizon’s websites, showcased innovative approaches that went beyond being just ticketing platforms. These insights inspired us to innovate further.</p>

    <h2>Structuring for User Flow</h2>
<p>
Creating a user flow that maintained a sense of control for the user and kept the experience as frustration-free as possible was a primary focus of this design.
<br><br>
As a supplement to the band’s presence, we found that featuring each section of the website partially on the homepage — with the ability to expand into individually focused pages — was ideal. This allowed for a unique and creative approach to the home screen.
</p>

    <h2>Stylistic Incorporation</h2>
<p>
To further expand on the band’s unique identity, a great deal of care was taken in the site’s design — combining rough, static elements with a more modern flair.
<br><br>
The hover and grain effect animations not only amplified key ideas from the branding but also provided effective contrast against the static, grunge-inspired background textures and physical photography elements, such as tape and rips.

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>
As the site’s primary focus was to promote the release of their upcoming EP, we showcased their released music boldly. We aimed to innovate on this concept by allowing users to watch music videos and read along with the lyrics of each song — fostering a stronger, more personal connection between the musicians and their audience, especially newer fans.
<br><br>
To add additional flair, static elements from the branding were incorporated as interactive features. This further reinforced the band’s unique tone of voice and strengthened their overall brand identity.

    <h2>Campaign Focus</h2>
<p>
Building on their “Kick in the door” slogan, we created a temporary interactive door that users could “kick in” to enter the site. This immediately captured attention and helped the site stand out from others.
<br><br>
For the upcoming release of their song “Sweater,” we also introduced a temporary page. Each day leading up to the release, users could rip off a digital clothing patch — inspired by the band’s merch — directly on the page. Each patch revealed discount codes for exclusive merchandise, building anticipation and encouraging ongoing engagement with fans in the lead-up to the release.

    <h2>Hierarchy in Design:</h2>
<p>
For several sections of the site, hierarchy and clarity were key in presenting core information effectively, especially on pages like the tickets section. We paid close attention to industry standards and prioritized the most important elements before finalizing the design.

    <h2>Mailing List</h2>
    <p>
To bring more awareness to the band, signing up for the mailing list was made an optional feature on every page — included in the footer as well as a graphic element on the homepage.
<br><br>
This interactive feature offered a more engaging and playful way to highlight an important aspect of the band’s growth strategy, helping to maintain fan engagement as they continued to explore the website.

    <h2>Personal Stories</h2>
    <p>Keeping inline with the interactive focus of the site, the about page for the band inspired to showcase their personal story uniquely by allowing the uses to tear off the tape elements to reveal each section. Accompanying this was a casette tape, that functioned as a music player if the user chose click on the tape and play through the band's released msuic.
<br><br>
Bringing more focus to the personal aspects of the band and creating a more interesting about page than what is usually shown for muscians.
