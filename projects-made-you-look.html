  <h1 class="banner-text">Made You Look</h1>
  <p class="banner-hanging-number">Entering into the pop music space, a newly formed band comprising of Drummer/Producer Shelton Woolright and Vocalist/Producer Alex Thompson, needed a brand new brad identity and website.</p>
  <p class="project-date-top">Using the inspiration from their influences, namely Twenty One Pilots, and Blink 182, amoung more we created a strong brand ideantity and website focused around static grunge and more modern influenced ideas.</p>

    <h2>Branding and Focus:</h2>
    <p>
Based on the band predetermined aesthetic we created focused brand identity around this style. Utilizing a grunge-y meets modern take on the pop influences of the band we focused on patch-work and a rugged look that would be further expanded on in the campaigns collateral (Should this be in the overview?)
<br><br>
We delved deep into the style of Twenty One Pilots, and Post Malone among more grunge inspired musician pages. Taking heavy influence from their overall branding style and website’s focus.

    <h2>Research:</h2>
<p>
Several bands’ pages we felt had glaring issues, and only a few showed the ability to stand out and give the user any reason to use it.
<br><br>
We found some, such as Post Malone’s, and Bring me the Horizon’s sites showed innovative approaches outside of being just a ticketing service. Seeing these insights inspired innovate further.</p>

    <h2>Structuring for User Flow:</h2>
    <p>
Creating a user flow that maintained a sense of control for the user and a kept the experience as least frustrating as possible was a primary focus of this design.

As a supplement for the bands presence, we found having each section of the website partially displayed on the home page that could then be expanded on in their individual pages made for the most sense. Allowing for a dynamically and creative approach to the home screen.</p>

    <h2>Stylistic Incorporation:</h2>
    <p>

To expand further upon the bands unique identity a lot of care was taken to the design of the site. Combining rough, static elements with a more modern feeling flare. 
<br><br>
The hover, and grain effect animation, not only heightened some of the ideas in the branding but also contrasted effectively with the static elements, specifically of the grunge-y background textures and physical photography elements such as the tape and rips.</p>

    <h2>Music:</h2>
    <p>
As the site’s focus was to push the release of their upcoming EP, we showcased the music on the site. Inspired by our research we sought to innovate on this concept by allowing you to view the music videos and read along with the lyrics of each song.

Adding additional flare, static features used in the branding were incorporated as intractable elements with. This gave a modern feeling to the analogue look of these elements, and created a even more unique experience.

    <h2>Campaign Expansions:</h2>
    <p>Building upon their “Kick in the door” slogan we created a temporary intractable door to “kick in” to enter the site. This grabbed the attention of the user and enabled our site to stand out among others. 

For the upcoming release of their “Sweater” song temporary page was also present on the site. Each day leading up to the release, the user could rip off a patch on the page. This would help build anticipation around the release, and supply the user with reason to stay engaged with exclusive merch discount codes  </p>

    <h2>Hierarchy in Design:</h2>
    <p>For several of the sections Hierarchy and clarity was key. Especially in sections such as the tickets page. We paid close attention to the industry standard and most important elements to highlight before finalizing the design.</p>

    <h2>Mailing List:</h2>
    <p>

To bring more awareness to the band, signing up to the mailing was an optional piece of every page in the footer as well as graphic piece of the home page.
<br><br>
This interactive element created more fun way to push for an aspect we felt deserved more attention to further keep the engagement of the fans on the site.

    <h2>Personal Stories:</h2>
    <p>Keeping inline with the interactive focus of the site, the about page for the band inspired to showcase their personal story uniquely by allowing the uses to tear off the tape elements to reveal each section. Accompanying this process if they choose by they may also click on the tape to play through the bands songs.
<br><br>
This keeps an otherwise mundane page interesting and allows you to become more engaged with the band and their personal story.
