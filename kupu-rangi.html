            <h4 class="overview-title">Overview</h4>
            <p class="overview-blurb">Kupu Rangi was a response to current Kupu’s declining usage, caused  by a lack of immersive and culturally meaningful features. In a live brief in collaboration with Spark, we transformed the apps visual identity and features incorporating heavier use of AI, with a dedicated AI companion and focus around gamifaction, that incorporated cultural concepts to better immerse the users in a meaningful learning journey. This was further expanded on with Polaroid campaign as well as an explainer video and 
promotional video.</p>

                <p>For the release of Kupu Rangi, we created a simple explainer video, that walked you through the key features and purpose of the app. Showing it’s simple structure, user flow and core concept of learning through the maramataka themed star collection, and expanding your kahui whetu (constellations) as you learn Te Reo Maori</p>

                <p>Before the release of Kupu Rangi and promotional video was also made named “Kia Māia”. This followed a young New Zealander as he learns with the Nui (Kupu Rangi’s companion AI) Te Reo Maori, and connects more to the language.</p>

            <div class="paragraph-text-project" id="two-image-paragragh">
                <p>The learning process was kept simple, structuring the idea around of collecting star words that appear on your 3D interactive moon. Tapping on these star words would allow you to begin learning a word.</p>

                <p>Breaking the word down to its core meaning, and use in a sentence, you can then use your phones microphone to complete the process of learning the word. Finally swiping the learnt star word up and sending it off to form your kahui whetu (constellations) screen.</p>

                <p>You are also able to gain bonus words each day by using the camera feature. These will then be stored in your gallery, where you can reflect on your learning journey through you photographs. Helping with greater memory retention and adding another element to the learning experience.</p>

            <div class="paragraph-text-project">
            <p>Once you’ve learnt a word you can swipe up on your home screen to see your Kahui Whetu (constellations), this is how you track your progression in the app. Each star word you learn, brightens a constellation and in turn grows your universe. In you’re Kahui Whetu screen you are able to see the words you’ve learnt, how many you have yet to learn, and revisit the meanings of words you may have forgotten.</p>

            <p>Each star word, will appear in a constellation grouped with similar words to it. This makes filling up your universe less linear and more explorative. Allowing you to become more immersed in the language by surrounding yourself in the language.</p>

            <p>While using the app at anytime you can speak to Nui, the AI companion. This allows you to talk through and get a better understanding on how to use the words your learning.</p>

            <p>You can choose to message Nui using the messaging screen, or speak with him verbally using the call function. This is especially helpful for more complex breakdowns, pronunciations, helpful resources and conversational practice using your newly learnt words. While calling Nui you also able to get real-time, live word translations using the camera and video feature.

            <div class="paragraph-text-project" id="two-image-paragragh">
            <p>Accompanying the Kupu Rangi’s release, using the Spark stores as inspiration, a limited time Polaroid campaign was planned. The idea was simple and revolved around using Kupu Rangi camera feature to take photos of words you wanted to learn, which you could then get printed off as a personal Polaroid for you to keep and have as a physical memory of your learning journey, extending Kupu Rangis camera feature functionality further. These Poleriods would display unique information about the word, pronunciation, use in a sentence and current maramataka phase it was taken it.</p>

            <p>By choosing to share your Polaroid with a Spark store, you could have your memory pinned on that stores wall and connect with other users memories on their individual learning experiences. Additionally Spark would also reward you with a discount as an added benefit to your Kupu Rangi experience.

            <div class="paragraph-text-project">
            <p>During the creation of the app, Kupu Rangi went through several stages of user testing. These tests helped determine the best user flow and key features the app needed. As the app revolved around simple swipe gestures to access each screen, an easy structure and simple user flow, these tests was extremely important apps development to resonate with the target audience.</p>

            <p>Core concepts, especially those tied to culturally sensitive ideas, were crucial to approach with meaningful care. During this project, 4 user tests were conducted and extensive feedback was given in these tests and separately by the Spark team.</p>

            <div class="paragraph-text-project">
            <p>The final outcome is a detailed and culturally centred approach to the learning of Te Reo Maori, that highlights the importance of the language in our culture through an explainer video, promotional video, Polaroid campaign and language learning app.</p>

<p>It shows the effect that AI can have in human-centred design, and how when implemented well can help create a real impact in important everyday spaces. This project succeeded in bringing individuals closer to native language of New Zealand, and connecting individuals to a rich culture.</p>
